# sui
sui is a no bullshit minecraft gui library for creating a lot of inventories in a short amount of time.

### Credits

I've been looking for an inventory library that fits my needs for a long time, and there have been some things
I loved in some libraries.

[helper](https://github.com/lucko/helper) - This library is basically based on helper,
because it's what I've been using the most.

[canvas](https://github.com/IPVP-MC/canvas) - This library has also inspired helper, but has some other cool features which I've drawn inspiration from.

[ChickenPat](https://github.com/ChickenPat) - Big help with the default mask comparators
